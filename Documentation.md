This repository was created on January 26, 2024 with an initial README.md file with the title SoftwareEngineering saved in it.

Then on February 7, 2024, the index.html file was created by Jon Hamlin which has the skeleton code of an html document using the charset “utf-8,” the responsive meta tag:
"meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1", and the title of this page, which is Home.

On February 23, 2024, we all created 5 basic web pages for our calendar scheduling system: 
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Main/Home Page (index), Log in Page, Sign up page, Group Calendar page, and Individual Calendar Page 


The home/main page has a title and a simple paragraph explaining what will be done regarding the business that we’re making this for. 


The log in page has a place for a user to enter in their username and password so that eventually they will be able to log in and send a JSON request to the database, and then access their schedule along with the group schedule. 


The sign up page has a place for new users to enter in the necessary information needed to create a new account in the database (i.e. First and Last name, Phone Number, Email, Address, Username, and Password). It also has a cancel and submit button that will eventually allow users to either stop what they’re doing and delete all of the current information being displayed or send it all via a JSON request to the database. 


The group calendar schedule page has a place for a user to enter in their name, appointment date and time, appointment description, and a button to press that will eventually send a JSON request to the database. 


The individual calendar schedule page has the same places for a user to enter in their information as the group calendar schedule page along with the button that will eventually send a JSON request to the database.

On March 8th, we updated our web pages to include Bootstrap 5 for our CSS and added some common themes shared between all pages. 


We also created ways to collect user data from the input fields from our forms (not including the Home page) and send a stringified JSON object to the console (which can be seen using the inspect feature in a browser). 


There were also some quality of life updates to some of the web pages to make the design a little easier to read and look at as well as some modifications to our forms.

On March 15th, we changed the layout of our sign up, group, and individual calendar pages to have a better design then what we had previously had. 


The most significant changes happened to the sign up page in which the vertically stacked input fields were made to be side by side in two input fields per row fashion. It was also changed to reflect the current working version of the database which had split the address field into four separate fields: Street Address, City, State, and Zip/Postal Code. 
Also, the new version of the database has different required fields then the last one. The non-required fields include: Middle Initial, Suffix, Street Address, City, State, Zip/Postal Code, and Username. The required fields are: First and Last Name, Date of Birth, Phone Number, Email, Password, and Confirm Password. 


The group calendar page centered its form and added a user table that displays some information regarding the appointment times for the user. 


The individual calendar page also centered its form and separated the top, middle, and bottom sections with the "hr" tag in HTML. 


The home/main page has updated its title to now read: *Subpar Snips* along with a little description about what this business does.
